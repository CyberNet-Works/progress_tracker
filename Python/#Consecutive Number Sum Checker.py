Consecutive Number Sum Checker
Medium
Problem Description
Write a program to check whether a given number can be expressed as a sum of two or more consecutive positive numbers.

For example,

1 + 2 +3 = 6
4 + 5 = 9
Define a function named check_consecutive_sum() with a single argument n.
Inside the function, check whether the number can be expressed as a sum of consecutive numbers.
If the number can be represented as a sum of consecutive numbers, return True and return False otherwise.
