Challenge:
Palindrome Numbers Within a Range
Easy
Problem Description
Write a Python program to count the number of palindrome numbers within a given range.

A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

For example, numbers like 121, 1, 22 are palindrome numbers because their digits remain the same when reversed.

Define a function named count_palindromes() with two arguments: start_number and end_number.
Inside the function, return the total count of palindrome numbers.
Example
Test Input

10
20
Expected Output

1
Note: Both start_number and end_number in the range are inclusive.
