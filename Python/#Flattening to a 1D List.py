Problem Description
Write a program to flatten a list of lists into a single list.

Define a function named flatten_list() that takes a single argument list_of_lists.
Inside the function, create a new one dimensional list that contains all the elements from the sublists.
Return the newly created list.
The input format is:

number_of_lists_in_nested_list(n)
list_1
list_2
...
list_n
Example
Test Input

2
[0, 1, 2, 3]
[4, 5]
Expected Output

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
